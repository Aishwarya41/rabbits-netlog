The primary objective of the script is to facilitate the extraction if important data from the extensive netlog files
generated during the speed test procedures. These files typically have a lot of information requiring us to have a
script that can isolate the crucial and necessary events such as the 
URL requests representing the http flows and latency measurements. When we run our script, 
we get the output in the form of a JSON [{"id", "type", "progress:[{"bytecount", "time"}]}].
Our output has been formatted such that the each object in the JSON are separated by 'id', which are the 
http flow source ids. The type determines whether it was a download or an upload flow and the progress 
keeps track of the bytecount that was read at the given time. 

We chose to record bytecount and time so that we can calculate throughput by adding all the bytecounts for
the particular source id and dividing it by the start and the end time. 

The latency measurements are also tracked in a JSON object where each object has a distinct source id with instructions
send time and receive time. We are finding the HTTP_TRANSACTION_SEND_REQUEST_HEADERS, and the HTTP_TRANSACTION_READ_HEADERS
