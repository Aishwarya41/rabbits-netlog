## **Netlog Data Processor**

#### **Overview**

The Netlog Data Processor is a Node.js script designed to parse and analyze network log (Netlog) files generated by different test server. It extracts relevant information such as byte counts, latency, HTTP stream job IDs, and socket IDs from the log files and generates structured output files for further analysis.


#### **How to run**

Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.

Run the script using the following command from the root directory of the project:

    node netlog.js <path_to_netlog_file> <path_to_urls_file>


Replace <path_to_netlog_file> with the path to your Netlog file and <path_to_urls_file> with the path to the file containing URLs used for analysis.

The processed data will be written to output files in the output directory in the root of the project.


#### **File Structure**

netlog.js: Main Node.js script for processing Netlog data.

throughput.js : calculates the throughput using the bytetime and time provided by netlog.js file

output/: Directory containing output files generated by the script.

testServers folder: each test server has its own folder with the netlog file and urls file.

README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
